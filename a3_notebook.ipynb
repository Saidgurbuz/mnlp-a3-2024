        "\n",
        "- Please carefully read the detailed docstrings and the comments that start with `TODO` / `NOTE: caution`. While the `TODO`s will show where you should add code, the caution notes will point out what not to change.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Feel free to add testing cells below those already provided in this notebook (in [1.2) Test your implementations](#12-testing-your-implementation)). You are also welcome to write tests in the main function of `a3_decoding.py` and `a3_sampling.py`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Decoding algorithms expectations:**\n",
        "    - **Greedy:** your greedy decoder output **should** match huggingface's output. \n",
        "    - **Beam:** \n",
        "        - **Scores:** Sometimes for beam search, due to floating point precision or simply the way huggingface counts scores (*e.g.*, they sometimes threshold log probabilities), your scores may not align with theirs. Just aim for it to be around the same ballpark (~0.01 difference, but again we won't be so clear cut with this). We are not measuring how well you can replicate huggingface's implementation to the exact number. Therefore we will be flexible about this as long as your algorithm does the steps required. \n",
        "        - **Runtime:** Also, a `num_beams` larger than 15 can run longer than a minute; you don't have to write the most efficient beam search.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sampling algorithms expectations:** Due to slight implementation differences (*e.g.*, how you decide to *not* sample certain tokens), even if the random seed is set at testing time, your results may widely differ. Therefore if the output and its shape do not match exactly huggingface's output for sampling algorithms, you don't have to worry (and if they do, you don't have to worry either :D). In this tricky case, you can verify your implementation by playing with the parameters and seeing if they behave the way you would expect (Hint: think about the extreme cases of these algorithms and check if the algorithms behaves as you expect in those cases).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Read the documentation:** We already provide you with hints on how to pass tokens to the model (below and as a comment in the code), however you are responsible with reading the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2LMHeadModel) to fully understand what the `model` function expects as input and what the model returns.

BLEU score measures the similarity between the gold reference and the generated candidate. 100 means they are a perfect match, and 0 means none of the n-gram precisions get fulfilled. Note that this range may change to 1.0 to 0.0 depending on the implementation. such as the huggingface `evaluate` one:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **bleu:** As you learned in the exercise, the BLEU score is calculated by comparing the $n$-grams and combining their average precisions from $n$=1 to $n$=4 with a brevity penalty.\n",
        "    - **bleu-1:** Geometric mean of 1-gram precisions; it does not use the brevity penalty.\n",
        "    - **bleu-4:** Geometric mean of 4-gram precisions; it does not use the brevity penalty.\n",

In particular, you will be calculating [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu), [BERTScore](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bertscore), and [COMET](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/comet) with the linked huggingface evaluate functions. \n",

Just make sure they get eventually saved in a joint file called `part3_metrics.json` so that you can use it for correlation calculation; and make sure all of your code is uncommented at submission time."

        "We have succesfully calculated the NLG metrics for each hypothesis and stored them in `part3_metrics.json`. Now, we will calculate how much these scores correlate with human judgements in the `evaluate_metrics` function in `a3_mt_eval.py`. We will calculate [Kendall's tau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient) which requires ordinal, or in other words, ranked associations between data. One way we can turn the DA scores into ranks is to consider the human scores for various hypothesis of the same **source** and **language pair** as defining such ranks. For that you will create (worst_hypothesis, better_hypothesis) pair combinations. After getting the data you will calculate the correlation between the human scores and the metric scores and save it in `part3_corr.json`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that there are several ways to calculate Kendall's tau, we would like you to implement the first definition given in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient). You won't be penalized if you calculate a different version, but the results may differ.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will not need a GPU for this portion of the task. Similar to calculating the scores in the previous subsection, if you want to directly use the commandline to run the function, feel free to do set `already_predicted_scores=True` in the main function and run `python a3_mt_eval.py` instead of the following cell. Otherwise, run the following cell to generate the `part3_corr.json` file:"
